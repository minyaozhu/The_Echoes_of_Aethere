## **Prompts for Veo / VideoFX (Character Interaction)**

**Scene: The Discovery (Chapter 2)**
**Prompt**:
> Cinematic medium shot in a dimly lit, cluttered sci-fi workshop. **Elara** (short silver hair, wearing a patched enviro-suit) stands leaning over a workbench, her expression intense and hopeful. Beside her, **Kaelen** (a man in his 30s with thick goggles, sitting in a customized high-tech wheelchair) is pointing at a **glowing blue holographic map** projected from a small device on the table. The map illuminates their faces with a soft blue light.
>
> **Camera Movement**: Start with a medium shot of the two characters, then **slow dolly in** towards the glowing map, shifting focus from Elara's face to the hologram. Shadows flicker on the walls.
> **Style**: Cyberpunk, high contrast, 8k resolution, volumetric lighting, 35mm film grain.

**Scene: The Strategy (Chapter 6)**
**Prompt**:
> Close-up two-shot of Elara and Kaelen in a narrow, metallic ventilation shaft. The lighting is low, red emergency lights pulsing. Elara is whispering into a comms device. Kaelen is typing on a wrist-mounted computer, looking stressed.
>
> **Camera Movement**: Handheld shakiness to imply tension. The camera pans slightly between Elara's determined face and Kaelen's nervous expression.
> **Style**: Claustrophobic, gritty realism, sweat on skin texture, dramatic shadows.
