# **The Echoes of Aethere: World-Building**

## **Aethere**

A massive, floating city-state, roughly the size of old Tokyo, held aloft by immense antigravity generators and colossal solar sails.
- **Elevation**: Aethere floats at an altitude of approximately 20,000 feet above the Earth's surface, just above the "Shroud".
- **Population**: ~2.5 million.
- **Society**: Divided into three tiers:
    1.  **High-Born**: Live in the "Citadel of Light," the highest and most stable platforms, accessing the most direct sunlight for their solar arrays.
    2.  **Mid-Strata**: The bustling, industrial and residential core, where most citizens live and work.
    3.  **Low-Platforms**: The dangerous, poorly maintained structures closest to the Shroud, where cloud harvesters, scavengers, and criminals operate.

## **The Shroud**

The toxic cloud layer that blankets the Earth's surface, rendering it uninhabitable.
- **Composition**: A cocktail of industrial pollutants, volcanic ash, and strange, luminescent spores.
- **Color**: Ranges from a murky purple at twilight to a sickly yellow-grey during the day.
- **Dangers**:
    - **Cloud Sharks**: Mutated avian predators that evolved to glide on thermal vents.
    - **Corrosion**: Anything dropped into the Shroud is eaten away within days.
    - **Madness**: Prolonged exposure is rumored to cause hallucinations and insanity.

## **The Cloud Harvesters**

A loosely organized guild of daredevils and scavengers. They use specialized suits and platforms to descend into the upper layers of the Shroud to collect valuable resources.
- **Gas**: Rare isotopes fuel Aethere's older tech.
- **Water**: Condensed vapor is the city's primary water source.
- **Gas**: Rare isotopes fuel Aethere's older tech.
- **Water**: Condensed vapor is the city's primary water source.
- **Relics**: Items occasionally drift up from the Old World on thermal updrafts.
- **Tech**: Harvesters use modified winches, magnetic grapples, and filtration systems.

## **Council Technology**
- **Patrol Skiffs**: Sleek, white, silent anti-gravity craft used for surveillance. Equipped with thermal scanners, searchlights, and gravitational stabilizers.
- **Platform Architecture**: Older platforms (like Beta-7) rely on massive intake turbines for power and stability, creating a network of noisy, dangerous industrial zones.

## **Politics**

- **The High Council**: Governs Aethere. Currently led by **Councilor Thorne**, a staunch isolationist who believes the surface is forever lost and that looking down is a waste of resources. They control the flow of energy and information.
- **The Seekers**: An underground movement that believes the Shroud is thinning and that humanity can one day reclaim the surface. They operate in secret, often aided by sympathetic Cloud Harvesters like Elara.
