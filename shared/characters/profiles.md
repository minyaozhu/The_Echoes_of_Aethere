# **The Echoes of Aethere: Characters**

## **Elara Vance**
- **Role**: Protagonist / Cloud Harvester
- **Age**: 24
- **Appearance**: Wears a specialized enviro-suit patched with mismatched leather and alloy scraps. Her hair is short, choppy, and dyed an unnatural silver (common among Harvesters to prevent radiation sickness, though that's an urban legend).
- **Personality**: Curious, risk-taker, loyal to her small crew but skeptical of authority. Has a talent for finding the impossible.
- **Motivation**: Wants to prove the surface isn't just death. Believes her parents' disappearance was linked to a discovery about the world below.

## **Kaelen**
- **Role**: Confidant / Engineer / Tech Expert
- **Age**: 30ish (Claims he stopped counting when he lost his leg in a Cloud Shark attack).
- **Appearance**: Often seen in a wheelchair he built himself, heavily modified with salvaged drone parts. Wears thick, magnify-goggles constantly.
- **Personality**: Grumpy, brilliant with old-tech, terrified of heights but somehow ended up living on a floating city. Deeply cares for Elara, almost like an older brother.
- **Backstory**: Was once a promising architect in the Citadel but was exiled for trying to improve the city's aging stabilizers with unauthorized designs.

## **Councilor Thorne**
- **Role**: Antagonist / High Councilor
- **Age**: 55
- **Appearance**: Tall, impeccably dressed in the pristine white of the High Council. Always wears gloves. Cold, calculating eyes.
- **Ideology**: Believes Aethere is humanity's only salvation and that hope for the surface is a dangerous distraction. "Preservation above Ambition."
- **Secret**: Has evidence that the cloud layer IS thinning but is suppressing it to maintain his power and the strict social order of Aethere. The return to the surface would dismantle the systems he controls.

## **Silas**
- **Role**: Fence / Smuggler / Temporary Ally (then Traitor)
- **Age**: 40s
- **Appearance**: Greasy hair, wears a coat lined with hidden pockets, always chewing on a synthetic stimulant stick. Missing two fingers on his left hand.
- **Personality**: Paranoid, profit-driven, but has a strange code about "preserving the old ways"—which mostly means hoarding pre-Collapse junk.
- **Motivation**: Survival and credits. He hates the Council not for ideological reasons, but because their taxes bleed him dry.

## **Dr. Aris Thorne**
- **Role**: Catalyst / Historical Figure
- **Status**: Deceased (Presumed)
- **Significance**: Father of Councilor Thorne. Lead scientist of Project Aether-Zero. Discovered the surface was healing 50 years ago.
- **Legacy**: His message in the amber capsule is the key to Elara's journey.
