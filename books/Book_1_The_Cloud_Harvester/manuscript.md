# **The Echoes of Aethere: Book 1 - The Cloud Harvester**

## **Chapter 1: The Weight of Clouds**

The air in Aethere always tasted slightly of ozone and damp metal. For Elara Vance, it was the taste of home, but today, it tasted like danger.

She secured her harness, the leather creaking slightly as she leaned over the edge of the Harvester Platform Beta-7. Below her, the Great Cloud Sea roiled in endless churns of toxic purple and bruised grey. It was a beautiful death, she thought, the kind that promised peace but delivered suffocation within seconds.

"Readings are spiking again, Elara," Kaelen called out from the monitoring station, his voice crackling through her earpiece. "Seriously, can you not push it today? The wind shear is brutal."

"I see it, Kaelen," Elara muttered, her eyes locked on a swirling vortex of mist about fifty meters down. It wasn't just a random eddy; it was a distinctive spiral pattern she'd seen in the old diagrams. A 'Vent.'

Most people in Aethere believed the Cloud Sea was just waste—the accumulated pollution of the Old World that had forced humanity to the skies. But the Harvesters knew better. The clouds were full of resources: rare gases, condensed water vapor, and sometimes, if you were lucky, artifacts caught in the updrafts.

Elara wasn't looking for gas today.

"I'm going down," she announced, releasing the brake on her winch.

"Elara! The Council's patrol skiff is due in ten minutes. If they catch you diving below the safety line..."

"They won't catch me if I'm fast."

She dropped. The wind roared in her ears, tearing at her goggles. Aethere, the massive floating city of glass and solar sails, shrank above her, a glittering jewel suspended in the void. As she descended, the light dimmed. The purple fog swallowed her boots, then her knees.

Her breath hitched. This was the Forbidden Zone. No one was supposed to go this deep. The toxins here could eat through a standard filter in minutes. She checked her wrist gauge: *Filter Integrity: 92%*. Good.

She steered her descent toward the spiral. In the center of the vortex, something glinted. Not the dull rust of old girders, but something bright. Gold? No, not gold. *Amber*.

She reached out, her gloved fingers brushing against the cold, wet mist. Her grapple hook shot out, latching onto a protruding piece of wreckage near the object. She swung herself closer, fighting the turbulence.

It was a capsule. Small, smooth, and pulsating with a faint, rhythmic light.

"Gotcha," she whispered.

Suddenly, a shadow fell over her. Not from a cloud, but from something above. A sleek, silent shape cut through the mist. The Council patrol.

"Kaelen," Elara hissed, "tell me you didn't just jinx me."

"I told you! Get back up here, now! Skiff on approach, vector 3-9!"

Elara grabbed the capsule, shoved it into her pouch, and slammed the winch retraction. The motor screamed in protest as it hauled her upward, back toward the light, back toward Aethere. But as she broke the surface of the cloud functionality, she saw the patrol skiff hovering near her platform.

Councilor Thorne stood on the deck, his grey uniform perfectly pressed, his eyes scanning the mist. He wasn't looking for gas leaks. He was looking for *her*.

Elara held her breath, dangling just below the platform's edge, the capsule humming warm against her side.

*What have I found?* she wondered. *And why is the Council so afraid of it?*

The whir of the patrol skiff's gravitational stabilizers was a low thrum that vibrated in her chest. It was too close. If she engaged the winch now, the motor's whine would give her away instantly. But hanging here was a death sentence; the corrosive dampness of the upper Shroud was already starting to tickle the back of her throat, a sign her filter was working overtime.

"Elara," Kaelen's voice was a ghost of a whisper in her ear. "Thorne's scanning the thermal bands. You're lighting up like a solar flare down there."

"I know," she breathed, her mind racing. The platform above was a lattice of rusted steel and reinforced glass. To her left, a maintenance hatch—welded shut years ago, if she remembered the specs correctly. To her right, the intake vent for the main turbine.

It was active. The massive blades were spinning slow enough to see, but fast enough to turn a human into mist.

"Kaelen, drop the turbine output to 15%."

"Are you insane? That'll destabilize the whole platform! The Council will alert immediately."

"Do it! Or Thorne finds me and the Amber capsule. Which is worse?"

A pause. Then, the hum of the platform above her shifted key. The turbine’s roar dropped to a stuttering cough.

*Now.*

Elara unclipped her main line, trusting her secondary magnetic grapple. She swung out, timing the arc perfectly. As the turbine blades slowed to a lazy crawl, she shot through the gap between them, tucking her knees to her chest. She cleared the blades by inches, the wind buffering her like a physical blow.

She landed in the maintenance crawlspace behind the turbine housing, her boots skidding on slick, oily grating. She scrambled into the shadows just as the turbine roared back to life, Kaelen restoring power before the alarms could trigger. The sudden noise masked her landing perfectly.

Through the grate, she could see the underside of the patrol skiff. It hovered for another moment, its searchlights sweeping the empty space where she had just been dangling.

Thorne’s voice drifted down, magnified by the skiff’s speakers. "Sector Clear. But keep the sensors active. I smell ozone and... something else. Something old."

The skiff turned, its sleek, white hull gleamng in the harsh sunlight of the upper atmosphere, and ascended back toward the Citadel.

Elara slumped against the cold metal wall, her heart hammering against her ribs. She pulled the capsule from her pouch. In the shadows of the crawlspace, its rhythmic pulse seemed brighter, more urgent. It wasn't just a light; it was a heartbeat.

"Kaelen," she said, her voice trembling slightly. "I'm in. But we have a problem."

"Besides almost dying? What?"

She looked at the capsule. The amber light was projecting a small, holographic set of numbers onto her glove. Coordinates. But not for anywhere on Aethere.

"I think this thing wants to go home," she whispered. "And home is a long way down."

## **Chapter 2: The Ghost Pattern**

Kaelen’s workshop smelled of ozone, stale coffee, and unauthorized soldering. It was a cramped nest of wires and monitors hidden deep within the rusting ribs of Sector 4, far below the pristine decks of the Citadel.

He spun his chair around as Elara ducked through the pressure door, her enviro-suit dripping condensation onto the grated floor.

"You’re insane," he greeted her, though his hands were already reaching for a scanner. "Completely certifiable. If Thorne had caught you—"

"He didn't." Elara stripped off her goggles, revealing the red imprint they left around her eyes. She pulled the capsule from her pouch and set it on the workbench.

In the dim light of the workshop, the artifact looked even more alien. It wasn't just amber; it was a complex lattice of crystalline layers, suspended in a golden suspension field. It hummed, a low vibration that rattled the loose screws on the table.

Kaelen adjusted his magnify-goggles, leaning in close. "This isn't Council tech. It’s not even Pre-Collapse industrial. Look at the casing. It’s bio-compatible polymer."

"English, Kaelen," Elara said, leaning against a stack of server units. Adrenaline was fading, leaving her limbs heavy and shaking.

"It means it was grown, not built," he murmured. He plugged a data-jack into a port on the side of the capsule. "Let's see what you have to say."

The screens on the wall flickered. Static washed over them, followed by a stream of garbled code. Then, the hum of the capsule spiked. A beam of light shot up from its center, coalescing into a holographic projection in the middle of the room.

It was a map. But not of Aethere.

It was a topography of the surface. Mountains, valleys, and... rivers. Blue, flowing rivers.

"That's impossible," Kaelen breathed. "The archives say the surface is a scorched wasteland. Nothing flows down there but lava and toxic sludge."

The map zoomed in on a specific location—a valley ringed by jagged peaks. A pulsing green dot marked the center.

A voice crackled from the workshop speakers. It was distorted, layered with decades of static, but the urgency was clear.

*"This is Dr. Aris Thorne. Project Aether-Zero. Day 4,000. The filtration shield is stable. The valley is green. Repeat: The valley is green. The Shroud is thinning faster than predicted. We are sending the coordinates for the reclamation point. If anyone is listening... come home."*

The hologram flickered and died.

Silence stretched in the workshop, heavy and suffocating.

Elara stared at the empty space where the map had been. "Aris Thorne?"

Kaelen pulled up a query on his main console, his fingers flying across the keys. "Searching... restricted archives... secure clearance bypass... got it."

He turned the screen toward her. A grainy photo of a younger man, standing next to a very young, very serious boy.

"Dr. Aris Thorne," Kaelen read. "Lead atmospheric scientist. Disappeared fifty years ago alongside his research team. Declared 'Lost to the Shroud' by the High Council."

Elara pointed to the boy in the photo. "And that?"

"His son," Kaelen said, his voice grim. "Current High Councilor Silas Thorne."

Elara felt a chill that had nothing to do with the cold of the upper atmosphere. "Thorne’s father found a way to live on the surface. And Thorne buried it."

"He didn't just bury it, Elara. He built his entire regime on the lie that there *is* nowhere else to go." Kaelen unplugged the capsule, his hands trembling. "If anyone finds out we have this..."

"They'll kill us," Elara finished. She grabbed the capsule, shoving it back into her pocket. "We can't stay here. Thorne’s skiff picked up the energy signature. He’ll be tearing the lower sectors apart looking for 'something old.'"

"Where do we go?" Kaelen asked, looking around his workshop—his sanctuary—as if seeing it for the last time.

Elara zipped up her suit, her jaw setting into a hard line. "We go to the only person in Sector 4 who hates the Council more than we do. And who knows how to hide things that shouldn't exist."

"Silas," Kaelen groaned. "Elara, he's a fence. He'd sell his own mother for a clean water filter."

"He's also the best smuggler in the city," she said, opening the pressure door. "Grab your portable rig. We’re moving."

As they stepped out into the smog-choked corridor, the alarms in Sector 4 began to wail.

The hunt was on.

## **Chapter 3: The Fence**

Sector 4 was a maze of rusted gantries and leaking steam pipes, a place where the sun was just a rumor. Here, in the belly of Aethere, the air was thick with the smell of recycled oil and desperation.

Elara kept her hood up, guiding Kaelen’s hover-chair through the crowded market of the "Rust Sprawl." Vendors shouted over the din of industrial scrubbers, selling everything from water filters to illegal datachips.

"Silas's den is just past the condenser array," Elara murmured, her eyes scanning the shadows for Council drones.

"I still think this is a mistake," Kaelen hissed, clutching his portable server deck to his chest. "Silas hates me. Remember the incident with his robotic parrot?"

"You reprogrammed it to squawk 'Counterfeit!' every time he sold a fake relic. It was funny."

"He didn't think so."

They ducked into a narrow alleyway that smelled of burnt circuitry. At the end stood a heavy blast door, covered in layers of graffiti and grime. Elara hammered a rhythmic code onto the metal.

A slat slid open. A single, bloodshot eye peered out.

"We're closed," a gravelly voice grunted. "Come back when the Council isn't tearing the sector apart."

"We have something for you, Silas," Elara said, lowering her voice. "Pre-Collapse. High-grade."

The eye narrowed. "You and every other scavenger this week. Unless it's a functioning fusion cell, get lost."

Elara pulled the capsule from her pocket, letting the amber glow illuminate the dark alley for a split second.

The slat slammed shut. A moment later, the heavy bolts of the door groaned and retracted. The door swung open.

Silas stood there, his greasy coat hanging off his gaunt frame like a shroud. He chewed on a glow-stick, the green light reflecting off his missing fingers.

"Inside," he barked. "Now."

His workshop was a cavern of clutter. Piles of scrap metal reached the ceiling, intermixed with shelves of strange, dusty objects—an old internal combustion engine, a stack of paper books, a plastic mannequin head.

"You brought heat to my doorstep, Vance," Silas spat, limping over to a workbench. "The Council has drones sweeping every level. They're looking for a specific energy signature. Yours?"

"Accidentally," Elara lied. "We found it in the Deep Cloud. We need a place to stash it until the heat dies down. And we need transport."

"Transport?" Silas laughed, a dry, hacking sound. "To where? The Citadel? You think Thorne will give you a medal?"

"To the coordinates inside it," Kaelen blurted out.

Silas froze. He turned slowly, eyeing the engineer. "Coordinates? To what?"

Elara stepped forward. "The surface. It's real, Silas. We saw a map. Green valleys. Water."

Silas stared at her for a long moment, then burst into laughter. It was a harsh, bitter sound. "The Green Myth? You're chasing ghost stories, girl. The surface is death. My grandfather went down there. He didn't come back."

"This is different," Elara insisted. "It's from Aris Thorne. The original data."

Silas stopped laughing. The name hung in the air like a curse. He walked over to Elara, extending his good hand. "Let me see."

Elara hesitated, then handed him the capsule. Silas specialized in old tech; if anyone could verify it, he could.

He held it up to the light, squinting. He didn't use a scanner; he used a jeweler's loupe. "Bio-polymer casing... lattice memory core... this is the real deal."

His demeanor shifted. The greed in his eyes was replaced by something else. Fear? Calculation?

"I can hide it," Silas said quietly. "I have a lead-lined vault in the back. Council scanners can't penetrate it. But it'll cost you."

"Name your price," Elara said.

"The Windrunner," Silas said, pointing to Kaelen. "And your customized nav-algo."

"No!" Kaelen shouted. "That's my life's work!"

"Small price for your lives," Silas shrugged. "Thorne's enforcers are thorough. If they find you with this, you won't make it to the brig. You'll 'fall' off the edge."

Elara looked at Kaelen. He looked sick, but he nodded slowly.

"Fine," Elara said. "Hide it. We'll lay low in the crawlspaces for a few cycles. When the patrols ease up, we come back, we pay you, and we take it."

"Deal," Silas grinned, his teeth stained green from the chemical stick. He walked to the back of the room, opening a heavy floor safe. He dropped the capsule inside and spun the lock.

"Smart choice," he said. He tapped a console on his desk. "I'll even throw in a tip. Use the maintenance vents in Sector 7. Less patrols."

"Thanks, Silas," Elara said, guiding Kaelen back toward the door. "You're all right."

Silas watched them leave, his grin fading. As the door clicked shut, he looked down at his console. A red light was blinking. Priority Channel: High Council.

He hesitated, his finger hovering over the transmission button. He looked at the safe, then at the door where Elara had exited.

"Green valleys," he muttered to himself. "Who needs valleys when you can have a penthouse in the Citadel?"

He pressed the button.

"This is Silas," he said into the mic. "Get me Councilor Thorne. I have his inheritance."

## **Chapter 4: The Betrayal**

Sector 7 was quieter than Sector 4, which Elara usually liked. It was the district of the air recyclers, massive, humming machines that scrubbed the CO2 from the city’s atmosphere. The noise was a constant, low thrum that vibrated in your bones.

"I don't like this," Kaelen muttered, his hover-chair navigating the slick metal grating with practiced ease. "Sector 7 is a dead zone. No cameras, no witnesses."

"That's the point," Elara whispered back. "Silas said the patrols are light here."

"Silas also tried to sell me a 'rare' combustion engine that was just a painted lawnmower," Kaelen shot back. "Why did we trust him?"

"Because he's greedy," Elara said, checking a corner before advancing. "Greedy people are predictable. He wants the capsule's value. He can't sell it if we're dead."

"Unless the bounty on our heads is worth more."

Elara stopped. A chill ran down her spine. The air recyclers ahead had gone silent.

The low thrum... it was gone.

"Kaelen," she said, her voice tight. "Why did the recyclers stop?"

Kaelen tapped frantically on his wrist-comp. "I… I don't know. The grid is showing a sector-wide reboot. That shouldn't—"

*CLANK.*

A heavy metallic sound echoed from the darkness ahead. Then another from behind.

Floodlights, blindingly white, erupted from the gantries above. Elara threw her arm up to shield her eyes, but the glare was overwhelming.

"Don't move!" a voice boomed, distorted by amplifiers. "By order of the High Council, you are detained."

Silhouettes descended on rappel lines—sleek, armored figures in the grey and white of the Council Guard. Note-perfect execution. A classic pincer movement.

"It's a trap!" Kaelen yelled, spinning his chair to flee back the way they came.

"No!" Elara grabbed his shoulder. "Look!"

Behind them, a massive blast door was sliding shut, cutting off their retreat. Standing in the center of the closing gap, illuminated by the harsh lights, was a familiar figure in a greasy coat.

Silas.

He wasn't looking at them. He was counting a stack of credit chips, his face illuminated by their blue glow.

"Silas!" Elara screamed, betrayal burning hotter than the lights. "You promised!"

He looked up then, a flicker of something—shame?—crossing his face before he shrugged and the door slammed shut with a finality that shook the floor.

"Secure them," the voice commanded.

Guards swarmed them. Elara fought, her instincts kicking in. She ducked a stun-baton, sweeping the legs of the first guard. He went down with a grunt, but two more were on her instantly. Magnetic cuffs snapped around her wrists, pinning her arms to her sides.

"Kaelen!"

She saw two guards tipping Kaelen's chair, dumping him onto the cold metal floor. He cried out as his bad leg hit the grating, his portable deck skittering away.

"Leave the tech," the commander ordered. "Bring the girl. Bring the cripple. Thorne wants them alive."

They dragged Elara not to a cell, but to a waiting transport skiff hovering silently above the recyclers. As they shoved her inside, she saw the commander holding something.

The Amber Capsule.

They had it. Silas hadn't just sold them out; he had given Thorne everything.

As the skiff rose, leaving the dark, treacherous depths of Sector 7 behind, Elara looked at Kaelen, huddled on the floor of the transport. He looked defeated. Broken.

But Elara felt something else. Not fear. Not despair.

Rage.

Pure, cold rage.

*You want a war, Thorne?* she thought, staring at the white boots of the guard standing over her. *You just started one.*

## **Chapter 5: The Interrogation**

The holding cell in the Citadel was cleaner than any room Elara had ever been in. The walls were a seamless, polished white polymer that hummed with a subtle energy field. There were no bars, no chains. Just a force-shield shimmering across the open doorway.

Elara paced the small space, ignoring the sting of the disinfectant that filled the air. She checked the cell for weaknesses—vents, seams, anything. Nothing.

"Stop pacing," Kaelen whispered from the corner. He was sitting on the floor, rubbing his bad leg. They had taken his chair. "You're wasting oxygen."

"I'm thinking," Elara snapped, then sighed. "I'm sorry. I just... I hate him."

"Silas?"

"Thorne."

The force-shield deactivated with a hiss. Two guards stepped aside, revealing a figure in pristine white robes.

Councilor Thorne walked in, holding the Amber Capsule as if it were a chalice. He didn't look like a tyrant. He looked like a tired old man.

"Elara Vance," he said, his voice smooth and cultured. "And Kaelen of House Varis. Or what’s left of it."

"Skip the pleasantries," Elara said, stepping forward. "We know what that is. We saw the map."

Thorne smiled, a thin, sad expression. "Ah, the map. The Green Valley. A beautiful dream, isn't it?"

"It's not a dream!" Kaelen shouted, struggling to stand. "It's real! Your father sent it!"

Thorne's expression hardened. "My father was a brilliant man. But he was deluded by hope. He led hundreds to their deaths chasing that 'reality.'"

"He's not dead," Elara said. "The message... it was dated recently. The timestamp was valid."

Thorne placed the capsule on a sleek table in the center of the room. "Timestamps can be faked. Signals can loop for decades. What you found is an echo. A dangerous echo that threatens the stability of Aethere."

He tapped the capsule. The holographic map flared to life, filling the room with the image of the green valley.

"Look at it," Thorne whispered. "Lush. Vibrant. Life. Do you know what happens when you show a starving man a feast he cannot reach? He riots. He burns down his own house in a frenzy to get to it."

"So you keep them starving?" Elara challenged. "You lie to them?"

"I protect them," Thorne corrected. "The Shroud is thinning, yes. But the surface is still unstable. The ecosystem down there... it's alien. Mutated. Even if the air is breathable, the flora is aggressive. The fauna is lethal. My father's team didn't vanish because of the air, Elara. They were *eaten*."

Elara faltered. "You... you're lying."

"Am I?" Thorne tapped a sequence into the table. The hologram shifted. The green valley zoomed in.

Monstrous shapes moved through the trees. Vines that writhed like snakes. Creatures that looked like wolves but moved with insectile jerks.

"This is the last data packet my father sent," Thorne said softly. "Before the screaming started."

The room went silent. Kaelen looked pale.

"Why hide it?" Elara asked, her voice shaking. "Why not tell the people the truth? That the surface is dangerous?"

"Because hope is a virus," Thorne said. "If I show them this, they won't see the monsters. They'll only see the green. They'll try to go down. And they will die. Thousands of them. The stability of the City relies on the belief that *this* is the only sanctuary."

He picked up the capsule. "I am confiscating this. For the good of the people."

"You're wrong," Elara said, clenching her fists. "People deserve to choose. You're not protecting them. You're controlling them."

Thorne sighed. "Perhaps. But better a controlled life than a free death."

He turned to leave. "You will remain here until the public memory of your 'discovery' fades. Then... we will find a useful role for you in the waste reclamation sector. Goodbye, Elara."

The force-shield hummed back to life.

Thorne walked away, the capsule glowing in his hand.

Elara stared after him, her mind reeling. Was he telling the truth? Were the monsters real?

"Elara," Kaelen said, his voice trembling. "Did you see it?"

"See what? The monsters?"

"No," Kaelen crawled to the table where the hologram had been. "When he amplified the map... the resolution increased. Thorne has higher-level access codes than we thought."

"So?"

"So," Kaelen looked up, his eyes wide. "He didn't just show us the last data packet. He accessed the *live feed*."

Elara froze. "Live?"

"That monster didn't just move," Kaelen whispered. "It reacted to a shadow. A shadow that wasn't there fifty years ago. That feed is active, Elara. Someone is down there *right now*. Keeping the camera running."

Elara looked at the door where Thorne had vanished.

"His father," she breathed.

"Or someone else," Kaelen said, a spark of his old excitement returning. "It doesn't matter. Thorne lied about the timestamp. Which means he lied about everything else."

Elara went to the force-shield, pressing her hand against the humming energy. It stung, but she didn't pull away.

"We have to get out of here," she said. "We have to get that capsule back. And we're going to the surface."

"How?" Kaelen asked, looking at his useless legs. "We're locked in the highest security wing of the Citadel."

Elara turned to him, a fierce grin spreading across her face.

"You're the best hacker in Aethere, aren't you?" she asked. "And I... I'm a Cloud Harvester. I know how to navigate a storm."

She pointed to the ventilation grate high on the wall—the one she had been eyeing earlier.

"Thorne thinks he's protecting us from the chaos," she said. "Let's show him what a little chaos can do."

## **Chapter 6: The Breakout**

The ventilation shaft was tight, dark, and smelled of ozone. Elara dragged herself forward on her elbows, the metal grating digging into her skin. Below her, through the slats, she could see guards patrolling the pristine corridors of the Citadel's detention wing.

"Status," she whispered into her subdermal mic—thankfully, the Council hadn't scanned for Harvester-grade implants.

"I'm at the junction box," Kaelen’s voice came back, strained. He was still in the cell, working on the control panel with a shard of polymer he’d pried from the table. "This encryption is archaic but robust. Thorne's using a localized intranet. I can't access the main grid."

"Can you pop the lock?"

"Give me thirty seconds. But Elara... the moment this door opens, the silent alarm trips. You'll have maybe two minutes before every guard in the sector is on me."

"I'll be ready," Elara said. She had reached the main air circulation hub. A massive fan spun slowly above a drop that led straight down to the Mid-Strata. It was a long fall, but she’d made worse jumps for a tank of helium.

"Okay," Kaelen said. "Three... two... one. Chaos initiated."

The lights in the corridor flickered and died. Emergency sirens began to wail, a deafening, rhythmic pulse. The force-shield on Kaelen’s cell sizzled and vanished.

Elara didn't wait. She kicked the grate out. It clattered onto the walkway below, startling two guards. Before they could look up, she dropped.

She landed on the first guard, her boots slamming into his chest. He went down with a breathless wheeze. The second guard fumbled for his stun-baton, but Elara was already moving. She spun, sweeping his legs, and as he fell, she grabbed the baton from his hand.

*ZZZT.*

She jammed it into his armor's power pack. The suit seized up, locking him in a rigid paralysis.

"Clear!" she yelled.

Kaelen hobbled out of the cell, using the wall for support. "The lift override is locked! We can't go up!"

"We're not going up," Elara said, grabbing his arm. She pointed to the open air shaft. "We're going down."

"Elara, no. That's a trash chute!"

"It's a direct line to the loading docks! The Windrunner is impounded there!"

Guards were pouring into the corridor from the far end, laser sights cutting through the smoke. "Halt! Fire!"

A bolt of energy scorched the wall next to Elara's head.

"Jump!" she screamed, shoving Kaelen toward the edge.

"I hate you!" he yelled as he tumbled into the darkness.

Elara dove after him.

The fall was a blur of rushing wind and terrified screaming (mostly Kaelen's). Elara extended her arms and legs, creating drag to slow her descent. She saw Kaelen flailing below. She tucked and dove, catching up to him, grabbing his belt.

"Grapple!" she shouted.

She fired her wrist-mounted line (which the guards had missed in their arrogance—who checks a bracelet?). The hook caught on a reinforcement strut. The line went taut with a bone-jarring jerk, swinging them in a wide arc.

They crashed through a thin sheet of corrugated metal and rolled onto a pile of soft, synthetic packing foam.

They were in the loading bay. And there, sitting on a magnetic clamp pad, was the *Windrunner*.

It was ugly, dented, and painted a garish orange, but to Elara, it was the most beautiful thing in the world.

"My baby!" Kaelen scrambled up, ignoring his leg. He practically hugged the ship's landing strunt.

"Get it started!" Elara yelled, scrambling up the ramp. "We have company!"

The bay doors were opening. A squad of heavy troopers marched in, flanked by two combat drones.

"Surrender!" the lead trooper amplified.

Kaelen threw himself into the pilot's seat. "Systems... systems are offline! They put a mag-lock on the core!"

"Hotwire it!" Elara jumped into the co-pilot seat, her hands flying across the weapons console. "I'll buy you time."

She activated the ship's external cargo clamps. A crate of heavy ore lifted into the air. With a flick of her wrist, she hurled it at the troopers.

It smashed into the formation, scattering them like bowling pins. The drones opened fire, peppering the *Windrunner's* hull with plasma bolts.

"Kaelen!"

"Almost... almost..." Kaelen ripped a panel off the dashboard and twisted two wires together. Sparks flew. "Got it!"

The engines roared to life. The ship shuddered, lifting off the pad.

"Punch it!" Elara yelled.

Kaelen slammed the throttle forward. The *Windrunner* shot out of the bay, scraping its belly on the blast doors. They burst out into the open sky of Aethere, the wind screaming over the hull.

"We're clear!" Kaelen cheered.

"Not yet," Elara said, looking at the radar. "Look."

Three blips had just appeared on the scope. Fast. Agile. And closing in.

Patrol Skiffs.

"Thorne is sending the elite guard," Elara said grimly. "Chapter 7: The Suicide Run. Let's go."

## **Chapter 7: The Suicide Run**

The *Windrunner* was not built for combat. It was built to haul scrap and sniff out gas pockets. But Kaelen had made... modifications.

"Boosters!" Elara yelled as a plasma bolt sizzled past the cockpit canopy.

"Boosting!" Kaelen slammed a red lever. The ship lurched forward, G-forces pinning Elara to her seat. The *Windrunner* shot away from the Citadel, diving toward the cloud layer.

Behind them, the three patrol skiffs broke formation, moving in a perfect V-shape. They were faster, sleeker, and lethal.

"They're gaining!" Kaelen shouted over the roar of the engines. "We can't outrun them in open air!"

"Then we don't stay in open air," Elara said, grinning. She grabbed the comms. "Attention, Council vessels. You are pursuing a registered Harvester craft. Break off or we will initiate evasive maneuvers."

"Surrender immediately," a cold voice replied. "This is your final warning."

"Warning acknowledged," Elara said. She looked at Kaelen. "Dive."

"Into the Shroud?" Kaelen’s eyes went wide. "At this speed? The thermal shock will crack the hull!"

"Do it!"

Elara grabbed the yoke, pulling it hard to the right. The *Windrunner* rolled, spinning out of the path of a missile lock.

Kaelen cursed but engaged the dive sequence. "Venting coolant! Brace for impact!"

The ship plunged into the purple mist. Visibility dropped to zero instantly. The proximity alarms wailed as they threaded through the upper spires of the Low-Platforms.

"We lost them?" Kaelen asked, wiping sweat from his forehead.

"No," Elara pointed to the radar. The three blips were still there. "They're following us down. Thorne must have authorized a Deep Dive protocol."

"That's suicide for them too!"

"He wants that capsule back, Kaelen. At any cost."

The turbulence was bone-shattering. The *Windrunner* shook violently as it cut through the dense layers of smog. Acid rain lashed against the viewport.

"Hull integrity at 80%!" Kaelen yelled. "We can't keep this up!"

"We need to go deeper," Elara said. "Past the Harvester limit."

"Elara, the pressure down there... the Windrunner is rated for 20,000 feet. The surface is... we don't even know how far!"

"The artifact says it's there," Elara said, her hand resting on her pocket where she had stashed the capsule again. "Trust the map."

She pulled up the holographic coordinates. The green dot was pulsing steadily.

"Kaelen, shield frequency. Modulate to match the capsule's energy signature."

"What? Why?"

"Just do it! Aris Thorne said the filtration shield was stable. Maybe... maybe the capsule is the key."

Kaelen’s fingers flew across the console. "Matching harmonics... frequency 4-Alpha-Zulu... Elara, the ship is resonating with the capsule!"

A golden glow began to emanate from Elara's pocket, spreading through the cockpit, then the hull. The shaking subsided. The roar of the wind dampened to a hum.

"It's a shield," Kaelen breathed. "An Old World shield."

"And they don't have one," Elara said, looking at the radar.

One of the pursing blips vanished.

"Skiff 3 is down," Kaelen reported. "Imploded from the pressure."

Two left.

"They're still coming," Elara said. "Stubborn."

She pushed the throttle to maximum. "Let's see how stubborn."

The *Windrunner* streaked downward, a golden comet in the purple dark. The cloud layer grew thicker, darker. Lightning arced around them—violet bolts that would have fried their electronics if not for the golden shield.

"Approaching the Storm Wall," Kaelen warned. "This is the boundary of the Shroud. Below this... nobody knows."

"We're about to find out," Elara braced herself. "Punch it through!"

The ship hit the wall of turbulence. For a moment, everything was noise and light. The world spun. Elara screamed. Kaelen screamed. The ship groaned in metal agony.

Then... silence.

The shaking stopped.

The purple fog thinned.

And then, it broke.

Sunlight. Real, golden sunlight.

They were through.

"Systems recovering," Kaelen gasped. "Stabilizers coming online. Elara... look."

Elara opened her eyes. She looked out the viewport.

And gasped.

Below them stretched a land not of magma and death, but of endless, vibrant green. Forests. Rivers. Mountains capped with white snow.

It was more beautiful than the hologram. It was *real*.

"Current altitude 5,000 feet," Kaelen read, his voice filled with wonder. "Atmosphere... breathable. Oxygen levels optimal. Radiation... negligible."

"We made it," Elara whispered.

But the radar pinged again. A single, fast blip.

"One bandit remaining," Kaelen said. "And it's not a standard skiff. It's... bigger."

Elara looked back. Bursting through the cloud layer behind them was a massive, sleek interceptor. Black and gold. Thorne's personal flagship.

"He's here," Elara said, gripping the yoke. "Chapter 8: The Chase. He wasn't going to let his minions have all the fun."

"Shields up!" Kaelen yelled.

"Shields up!" Kaelen yelled.

The interceptor opened fire.

## **Chapter 8: The Chase**

Violet plasma bolts streaked past the *Windrunner*, burning the air. One clipped their port wing, sending a shower of sparks into the slipstream.

"We're hit!" Kaelen screamed, his hands flying over the damage control panel. "Port stabilizer is smoking! We're listing!"

"Hold it together!" Elara fought the yoke, forcing the ship into a corkscrew dive toward the forest canopy below. "He's got better range, better guns, and better speed. We can't dogfight him."

"Then what do we do?"

"We get low. Real low."

Elara leveled the ship out just meters above the treetops. The green blur of leaves and branches rushed past at terrifying speed. The *Windrunner's* wake shredded the upper foliage, sending a cloud of emerald debris into the air.

Thorne's interceptor roared behind them, its massive shadow falling over the jungle. It was a predator, sleek and deadly.

"He's locking on!" Kaelen warned. "Missile launch detected!"

"Flare!" Elara shouted, banking hard around a massive, ancient tree that looked like a skyscraper made of wood.

Kaelen punched the countermeasures. A burst of silver chaff exploded behind them. The missile veered off, slamming into the tree trunk. The explosion shook the *Windrunner*, debris peppering the shields.

"That was too close," Elara muttered. She looked at the terrain map. "Where's the valley? The coordinates?"

"Three clicks north!" Kaelen pointed. "Follow the river!"

Elara banked the ship, following the winding blue ribbon of water. The river cut through a canyon of red rock, offering some cover from Thorne's sensors.

"He's still there," Kaelen said, watching the rear monitor. "He's matching our moves. He's... Elara, he's herding us."

"What?"

"He's not trying to shoot us down anymore. He's pushing us toward the canyon exit."

Elara looked ahead. The canyon widened into a massive, open basin. The Green Valley.

And in the center of it, rising from the jungle floor like a white bone, was a structure.

A dome.

"That's it," Kaelen whispered. "Project Aether-Zero."

But as they burst out of the canyon, Elara saw why Thorne had herded them.

The basin wasn't empty. It was a nesting ground.

Hundreds of winged creatures—leathery, reptilian things with four eyes and razor-sharp beaks—took flight as the *Windrunner* roared into their territory.

"Cloud Sharks!" Kaelen yelled. "But... big ones! Ancestral variants!"

"Thorne knew," Elara realized. "He wanted the wildlife to do his dirty work."

The flock swarmed the *Windrunner*, their claws raking against the hull. The golden shield flickered under the assault.

"We have to land!" Elara shouted. "Get us to the dome!"

"I can't see! The sensors are clogged with... biology!"

Behind them, Thorne's interceptor pulled up, hovering high above the swarm. Watching. Waiting.

Elara saw a landing pad near the dome's entrance. It was overgrown with vines, but it was flat.

"Brace for crash landing!" she yelled.

She cut the engines. The *Windrunner* dropped like a stone, the sudden loss of heat confusing the heat-seeking predators for a split second.

The ship slammed onto the pad, skidding through the vines, metal screaming against stone. The landing gear snapped. The hull groaned. They spun, crashing into a stone pillar before coming to a violent halt.

Silence.

Smoke filled the cockpit.

"Kaelen?" Elara coughed, releasing her harness.

"I'm... still here," came a weak voice from the co-pilot seat. "Inverted. But here."

"We have to move," Elara said, kicking open the jammed canopy. "Thorne will be landing any second to pick through the wreckage."

They scrambled out of the broken ship. The air was warm, humid, and smelled of wet earth and flowers. It was intoxicating.

Above them, the swarm circled, confused by the crash. Thorne's ship began its descent, its landing thrusters burning away the vegetation.

"The dome," Elara pointed. The massive white structure loomed ahead, its airlock door sealed shut.

"Run," she said, helping Kaelen.

They limped toward the legacy of Aris Thorne, with the Shadow of the Council descending behind them.

They limped toward the legacy of Aris Thorne, with the Shadow of the Council descending behind them.

The monsters were real. But so was the sanctuary. Now it was just a race to see who would claim it.

## **Chapter 9: The Descent**

The entry to the Dome was guarded not by lasers or droids, but by vines as thick as a man's waist. They curled around the massive plasteel doors, pulsing faintly as if blood, not sap, flowed through them.

"Hurry!" Kaelen urged, dragging his injured leg. The sky above was darkening as Thorne’s interceptor lowered, its repulsor engines flattening the jungle canopy.

Elara shoved against the vines, but they were hard as iron. "It's sealed! The controls are overgrown."

"Use the capsule!"

Elara pulled the glowing artifact from her pocket. The moment the amber light touched the vines, they recoiled. The pulsing stopped. The thick tendrils unwound, slithering back into the shadows like frightened snakes.

"Bio-reactive security," Kaelen marveled. "My god, Aris really did use nature as his firewall."

The heavy doors groaned, the ancient hydraulics screaming in protest. A gap opened—just enough for them to squeeze through.

They stumbled inside, and the doors slammed shut behind them, sealing off the roar of Thorne's engines and the screech of the Cloud Sharks.

Silence returned. But this was a different kind of silence. It was the silence of a tomb.

The air inside was cool and sterile. Emergency lights flickered overhead, casting long shadows across a vast atrium. Standing in the center was a statue—no, a holographic projector—that flickered to life as they approached.

It was Aris Thorne. But older than the message. Gaunt. Haunted.

*"If you are seeing this,"* the hologram whispered, *"then you survived the gauntlet. Welcome to Aether-Zero. The last hope. And the first failure."*

"Failure?" Elara stepped closer. "What do you mean?"

*"The surface is habitable,"* Aris continued, as if answering her. *"But we were arrogant. We thought we could tame the wild. We didn't understand the Shroud wasn't just pollution. It was a cocoon. And what was growing inside it... wasn't ready to be disturbed."*

A loud BANG echoed from the other side of the door. The metal buckled.

"Thorne," Kaelen said, formatting his portable deck to interface with the facility's terminal. "He's cutting through."

"We need to find the control center," Elara said. "We need to send the signal to Aethere. Everyone needs to know."

"Aris said it was a failure, Elara!"

"He also said it was the last hope. I'm trusting the hope part."

They ran deeper into the facility, past labs filled with skeletal remains and shattered test tubes. The facility hadn't been abandoned; it had been overrun.

But by what?

They found the answer in the main corridor. A massive glass observation wall looked out into a subterranean garden. But the plants... they were moving. Carnivorous ferns snapped at moths the size of hawks. Trees walked on root-legs.

"The ecosystem evolved," Kaelen whispered. "The toxins in the Shroud... they acted as a mutagen. Accelerated evolution."

"That's why Thorne is afraid," Elara realized. "He knows humanity can't just land here. We'd be at the bottom of the food chain."

"But we can adapt," Kaelen said, pointing to a schematic on the wall. "Look. Aris designed a 'pacification frequency.' A sonic field that calms the flora. He never got to turn it on."

"Where is the control for it?"

"The Spire," Kaelen pointed to the top of the facility map. "The transmission dishes. If we activate the field, we tame the monsters. And we can broadcast the 'All Clear' to Aethere."

Another BANG. The blast doors flew open.

Thorne strode in, flanked by two elite guards. But he wasn't looking at Elara. He was looking at the hologram of his father, which was still looping its tragic message.

"Father," Thorne whispered, his voice cracking.

"He tried to save us," Elara yelled, stepping out from the shadows. "And you're trying to bury him!"

Thorne turned, his face a mask of cold fury. "I am trying to preventing his mistake from destroying us all! You saw the jungle! You saw the beasts! You want to bring *that* to our children?"

"We can fix it!" Kaelen shouted. "The frequency! The pacification field! It works!"

"It's a theory!" Thorne roared. "A desperate theory from a dying man! I will not gamble the fate of the City on a ghost story!"

He raised his weapon. "Give me the capsule. Now."

Elara looked at Kaelen. looked at the elevator to the Spire.

"No," she said.

She threw the capsule to Kaelen. "Run!"

Elara drew her stun-baton and charged the High Councilor of Aethere.

## **Chapter 10: The Green Valley**

(Note: The Green Valley was the location, but this chapter focuses on the conflict within it.)

The fight was brutal and short. Thorne was older, but he had reach and training. He sidestepped Elara's lunge, bringing the butt of his energy rifle down on her shoulder.

She cried out, rolling away before he could fire. "Go!" she screamed at Kaelen.

Kaelen scrambled into the elevator, jamming the "Up" button. The doors hissed shut just as a plasma bolt scorched the metal paneling.

"You are delaying the inevitable," Thorne said, ignoring Elara to aim at the rising car.

"Like you delayed the truth?" Elara swept his legs with her baton. He jumped, agile for an old man, but it forced him to lower his aim.

"My father's truth killed him!" Thorne roared, firing a spread of shots that Elara barely dodged. "He died screaming in this very hall! I saw the logs!"

"So you buried his work? Instead of finishing it?" It was a desperate gamble, but Elara needed to keep him talking. She needed to buy Kaelen time.

"I finished it by sealing it!" Thorne pressed the attack, driving her back toward the glass observation wall. Beyond the glass, the mutant jungle writhed. A massive, vine-covered beast slammed against the other side, drawn by the violence.

"Look at them!" Thorne gestured to the monsters. "That is what awaits us! Chaos! Evolution gone mad!"

"And what awaits us in the sky?" Elara countered, her back against the vibrating glass. "Starvation? The Shroud swallowing the lower platforms? We're dying slowly up there, Thorne. At least down here, we have a chance to fight!"

Thorne hesitated. For a second, the mask slipped. He looked at the monsters, then at Elara. "A chance to fight... or a chance to change?"

Suddenly, a deafening hum filled the room. The lights flickered.

"He did it," Elara whispered.

Up in the Spire, Kaelen had plugged the capsule into the main array. The facility groaned as power—ancient, geothermal power—surged through its veins.

The glass wall behind Elara began to vibrate with a low frequency.

The monsters outside stopped thrashing. The vines uncoiled. The beast that had been battering the glass paused, tilting its head as if listening to a song only it could hear.

"The Pacification Field," Thorne breathed, lowering his weapon. "It... it's working."

"Aris was right," Elara said, stepping away from the glass. "He just ran out of time. But we have time now."

Thorne looked at the calm jungle. For the first time in fifty years, the terror in his eyes faded, replaced by something resembling awe.

"It's beautiful," he murmured.

Then, the facility's speakers crackled to life.

*"Attention. Broadcast Array active. Signal locking: Aethere Citadel. Message loop: 'Come Home'. Sending..."*

"No!" Thorne snapped out of his trance. He raised his rifle again. "You cannot send that signal! If the people know... the City will descend into anarchy! The order I built... it will crumble!"

"Then let it crumble!" Elara shouted.

She lunged, not to attack, but to disarm. She grabbed the barrel of his rifle. They struggled, dancing on the edge of the abyss.

"I won't let you destroy my world!" Thorne screamed.

"Your world is already dead!" Elara yelled back.

In the struggle, the rifle discharged.

A beam of plasma shot upward, punching a hole through the atrium ceiling. Debris rained down.

One large chunk of plasteel slammed into the main console.

The speakers screeched.

*"Warning. Containment field unstable. Pacification frequency fluctuating."*

Outside, the monsters roared. The song was broken.

"What have you done?" Thorne whispered, horror dawning on his face.

The glass wall behind them cracked.

*CRACK.*

A spiderweb fracture spread across the surface.

"Run," Elara said.

The glass shattered.

Leaves, vines, and teeth poured into the atrium. The jungle reclaimed its own.

## **Chapter 11: The Confrontation**

Chaos erupted. The shattered glass unleashed a tidal wave of vegetation and fury. Thorne was thrown back by a thick vine that lashed out like a whip, pinning him against the far wall.

"My leg!" he screamed, his rifle skittering across the floor.

Elara scrambled up the debris pile toward the elevator shaft. She looked back. Thorne was struggling against the vines, but they were tightening, wrapping around his chest, his arms. The monsters were pouring in through the breach—slick, chittering things with too many teeth.

"Help me!" Thorne pleaded, his eyes wide with primal fear. "Vance! Don't leave me!"

Elara hesitated. He was a tyrant. A liar. He had tried to kill her.

But he was also human. And he was right about one thing: the surface was terrifying.

"Kaelen!" she shouted into her comms. "Status on the signal?"

*"Interference!"* Kaelen’s voice crackled. *"The console damage knocked the array out of alignment! I need to manually reroute the power to the secondary dish! It'll take two minutes!"*

"You have one!" Elara yelled. "I'm coming up!"

She looked at Thorne. A beast—something like a panther with scales—was stalking toward him, drool dripping from its jaws.

"Shoot it!" Thorne begged, pointing to his fallen rifle. "Please!"

Elara grabbed the rifle. She aimed.

Not at the beast. At the vines holding Thorne.

*ZZZ-CRACK.*

The plasma bolt severed the thickest tendril. Thorne fell to the floor, gasping.

"Run!" Elara shouted, firing a warning shot at the beast to drive it back.

Thorne scrambled to his feet, clutching his injured leg. He looked at Elara, confusion warring with gratitude.

"Why?"

"Because we're not you," Elara said. " Go! The service hatch on the north wall leads to the surface!"

Thorne limped toward the hatch. He paused at the door, looking back at the chaos—the monsters tearing apart the facility he had tried so hard to hide.

"You've doomed us all," he whispered. Then he vanished into the tunnel.

Elara turned and sprinted for the elevator shaft. The car was gone, but the cables were still there. She slung the rifle over her shoulder and began to climb.

Below her, the atrium was a slaughterhouse. The jungle was eating the technology.

She reached the top floor—the Spire Control Room. Kaelen was there, frantically pulling cables from a sparking server rack and plugging them into a portable generator.

"Elara! You made it!"

"Barely! Is the signal ready?"

"Almost! I just need to bypass the final safeguard. The system thinks the facility is compromised—which, y'know, it is."

"Bypass it!"

"I am! But... Elara, look at the screen."

Elara looked at the main monitor. It showed a view from the external cameras.

Thorne's interceptor was taking off. He had made it to his ship.

"He's leaving," Elara said. "He's going back to Aethere to marshal the fleet. If he gets there before the signal..."

"He'll jam us," Kaelen finished. "He'll nuke the site from orbit to bury the truth forever."

"Can we boost the signal strength?"

"If I route all power to the dish... maybe. But it'll fry the generator. One shot. One message."

Elara put her hand on Kaelen's shoulder. "Do it. Send it now."

Kaelen nodded. He typed a final command.

"Overiding safety protocols. diverting life support. Diverting shields. Maximizing gain."

The facility groaned. The lights died, plunging them into darkness illuminated only by the screen.

"Broadcasting in 3... 2... 1..."

A beam of pure energy shot from the Spire, piercing the clouds, piercing the Shroud.

It hit the relay satellites in orbit.

And then, it hit Aethere.

Every screen in the City—from the Council chambers to the lowest slums—flickered.

The image of Aris Thorne appeared.

*"This is Dr. Aris Thorne. Project Aether-Zero..."*

Then, the live feed cut in. The view from the Spire camera. The green valley. The blue sky. The mountains.

And Elara, bloody, exhausted, but alive.

She leaned into the microphone.

"People of Aethere," she said, her voice echoing across the sky. "My name is Elara Vance. And I am speaking to you from the ground. The air is clean. The water is fresh. The war is over."

She looked at Kaelen.

"Come home."

Static cut the feed. The generator exploded in a shower of sparks.

Silence returned to the Spire.

"Did it work?" Kaelen coughed in the smoke.

Elara looked out the window. High above, through the break in the clouds, she saw tiny specks descending. Thousands of them.

Skiffs. Shuttles. Gliders. Harvester platforms.

"Yeah," she whispered, tears streaming down her face. "It worked."

They weren't warships. They were refugees.

The sky was falling. And the world was beginning.

## **Chapter 12: Resolution**

The next few hours were a blur. The first ships to land were Harvesters. They didn't care about landing pads; they dropped onto the jungle floor, their pilots leaping out to touch the soil, weeping.

Elara and Kaelen made their way down from the Spire, bypassing the ruined atrium (now fully overgrown) and exiting through a maintenance hatch.

A crowd had gathered near the dome entrance. Scavengers, mechanics, and families from the Low-Platforms. They looked at Elara with awe.

A young girl—no older than ten—walked up to her, holding a flower. A real, blue flower.

"Is it true?" she asked.

Elara knelt, her knees aching. "Is what true?"

"That we can stay?"

Elara looked at the sky. More ships were coming. Heavy transports from the Mid-Strata. Even some sleek yachts from the Citadel. The exodus had begun. Thorne couldn't stop it if he wanted to.

"Yes," Elara said, taking the flower. "We can stay. But it won't earn itself. We have to build. We have to learn."

She looked at the jungle, at the strange, lethal beauty of it.

"And we have to survive."

Kaelen limped up beside her, leaning on a makeshift cane made from a pipe. "I just got a ping on the comms. Thorne's interceptor broke orbit."

"He's running?"

"He's gone. Set course for the Lunar Colonies. He knows he can't rule a people who have seen the sun."

"Let him go," Elara said. "He belongs to the past."

"So," Kaelen said, looking out at the valley. "What now? We're heroes. I could probably get my old job back. Redesign the whole city on the ground."

"You'd like that," Elara smiled. "Air conditioning. Solid floors."

"And you?"

Elara looked up at the break in the clouds. The *Windrunner* was a wreck, but she knew where to find parts.

"There's a whole planet out there, Kaelen," she said. "Somebody has to map it."

## **Epilogue**

**Six Months Later**

The settlement of *New Aether* was thriving. Prefab shelters dotted the valley floor, powered by the reactivated Geothermal Spire. The pacification field was stable, keeping the more aggressive fauna at bay, though "Gardener Duty" was still the most dangerous job in town.

Elara sat on the wing of the *Windrunner II*, watching the sunset. It was a riot of colors—orange, pink, violet. Colors she had never seen above the grey.

"Mail call," a voice called out.

Silas walked up the ramp. He was wearing a new coat—synthetic leather, very fashionable—and he had a new robotic finger.

"You're late," Elara said, jumping down. "The supply run from the Western Ridge was due at noon."

"Ran into a flock of razor-bats," Silas shrugged, dropping a crate of fruit. "Nasty little buggers. But they taste like chicken if you roast 'em right."

"Did you find it?"

Silas grinned, tapping his pocket. He pulled out a small, metallic chip.

"Data cache from an old server farm in the ruins of Seattle. Pre-Collapse charts. Ocean currents. Weather patterns."

"Perfect," Elara said, taking it.

"You know," Silas said, leaning against the hull. "Thorne sent a transmission yesterday. From the Moon."

"Yeah?"

"He says the air recyclers up there are failing. He wants to negotiate for... biological samples. Plants."

Elara laughed. "He wants seeds."

"The irony is thick enough to choke on," Silas agreed. "So, Captain Vance. Where to tomorrow? The Deserts of the South? The sunken cities of the East?"

Elara looked at the map on her wrist-comp. The green dot of the valley was surrounded by vast, unknown territories.

"West," she said. "I hear there's an ocean. And I want to see if the water really tastes like salt."

"West it is," Silas said. "I'll tell Kaelen to pack extra ammo."

Elara climbed into the cockpit. She fired up the engines. The hum was smooth, powerful.

She looked at the sky one last time. The Great Cloud Sea was still there, a bruise on the atmosphere. But it didn't look like a ceiling anymore.

It looked like a memory.

She punched the throttle. The *Windrunner* soared into the twilight, chasing the horizon.

**The End.**
