## Key Advantages for Authors
✅ Automate tedious editing tasks
✅ Build series bible automatically - extract world-building as you write
✅ Maintain consistency across books - agents reference shared knowledge
✅ Learns your voice - agents improve over time with your feedback
✅ Parallel processing - run multiple editing passes simultaneously
✅ Direct file modification - accept changes without manual copying
✅ Persistent workspace - knowledge base builds with each session
✅ Isolated per series - different worlds don't interfere

## Practical Agent Workflows
1. **Character Voice Consistency Agent**: Scans dialogue for consistency.
2. **Personal Writing Weakness Scanner**: Checks for overused words, passive voice, etc.
3. **Continuity Checker**: Tracks timeline and details.
4. **World-Building Extractor**: Updates wiki from manuscript.
5. **Dialogue Audit**: Checks distinct voices.
6. **Prose Quality Analysis**: Checks pacing, sensory details.
7. **Subplot Management**: Tracks threads.

## Artifacts
- **Implementation Plan**: Proposed approach.
- **Task List**: Concrete steps.
- **Analysis Reports**: Findings on voice, continuity, etc.
- **Review Changes (Diffs)**: Structured view of changes.
